\section*{About Us}
The Bearkat Association of Security and Hacking (BASH) at Sam Houston State University is a dynamic, student-led organization dedicated to empowering its members with cutting-edge blue team and red team cybersecurity skills. Our mission is to prepare students to excel as cybersecurity professionals through hands-on learning, collaboration, and engagement in competitions.

We actively participate in national cybersecurity competitions, including the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC), Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC), Hivestorm, and the National Centers of Academic Excellence Cybergames, where members hone their skills in real-world scenarios.

Beyond competitions, BASH holds bi-weekly meetings during the fall and spring semesters for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Competition preparation
    \item Certification training
    \item Professional development
    \item Capture the Flag (CTF) events
    \item Collaborative group projects
\end{itemize}
These activities foster creative problem-solving, bridge the gap between academia and industry, and build valuable professional connections.

\section*{Partnership}
At BASH, we aim to bridge the gap between academia and industry by fostering strong partnerships with cybersecurity companies and professionals. These collaborations provide our members with real-world insights, helping them navigate career paths and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape.

By partnering with us, sponsors gain access to a talented pool of motivated students eager to contribute to the industry. Guest speakers, workshops, and recruitment events hosted by our partners provide unique opportunities to inspire and connect with the next generation of cybersecurity experts.

\section*{Sponsorship Opportunities}
We offer three sponsorship tiers to support our club's initiatives and provide value to our partners. Sponsorships are valid for two academic semesters.

\section*{Future Plans}
To further enhance our hands-on learning environment, our future plans include setting up and maintaining a small-scale cyber range. This dedicated infrastructure will serve as a vital resource for advanced competition preparation and will enable us to host our own Capture the Flag (CTF) event to give back to the cyber community. Your support will be instrumental in making these initiatives a reality.
