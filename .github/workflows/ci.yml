# A name for your workflow, which will be displayed in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repo.
name: CI Pipeline

# This section defines the triggers for the workflow.
on:
  # Run the workflow when code is pushed to the "main" branch.
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  # Run the workflow when a pull request is opened or updated for any branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]

# This section defines the jobs that will run.
jobs:
  # We have one job in this workflow, which we've named "build-and-test".
  build-and-test:
    # This specifies the virtual machine environment to run the job on. "ubuntu-latest" is a reliable and common choice.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This section lists the individual steps the job will perform in order.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out our repository's code so the job can access it.
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the specific version of Node.js we want to use.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "22.0.0"

      # Step 3: Install dependencies. "npm ci" is used instead of "npm install" because it's faster and more reliable for CI environments.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run the linter. This assumes you have a "lint" script in our package.json file.
      - name: Run Linter
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Run the tests. This assumes you have a "test" script in our package.json file.
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm run test
