- **`app/`**: Contains all page-specific components and routes (e.g., `app/competitions/page.js` and its co-located components in `app/competitions/`).
- **`src/`**: Houses global, reusable components (e.g., `src/Navbar.js`, `src/Footer.js`).
- **`lib/`**: Stores utility functions, especially for API interactions (e.g., `lib/googleCalendar.js`).
- **`public/`**: Static assets like images and PDFs
- **`app/api/`**: Next.js API routes for backend data fetching (e.g., `app/api/ctf/route.js`).

### Environment Variables

**Event data is fetched from the Google Calendar API at build time.**

Setup: To connect to the API, you will need a Google Calendar API key. This key should be stored in an environment variable named GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY.

Environment Variables: Make sure to create a .env.local file and add the following variable. See the .env.example file for a template.

GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

Code Location: The logic for fetching the calendar data is located in lib/google-calendar.js.

Important: Do not commit your API key or .env.local file to GitHub.
